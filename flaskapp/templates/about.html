  <p>
    This web-application aims at improving the quality of your working hours
    by alarming you when you're drowsy.
  </p>
  <p>
    You're constantly monitored during your screen-time. The moment you yawn or
    nod-off an alarm goes off and a sms is sent to you at your
    registered mobile no.
  </p>
  <p>
  <h3 style="font-weight: bold; letter-spacing:1px">Special Feature(Care)<span style="color: yellow">ðŸ˜Š</span></h3>
  <p>
    If you nod-off for more than 30 seconds, your system goes in hibernate mode so that
    you can take a break and get a good nap.
