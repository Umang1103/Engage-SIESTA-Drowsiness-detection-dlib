## Working
Siesta is a webapp which optimizes your working hours by preventing you from drowsing off. You are constantly monitored during you screen-time, and you're sent an alert email if you're caught yawning or closing your eyes for some-time. If this continues for than 30 seconds(the duration has been kept short in the video for demonstration purposes), an alarm goes off and after some-time your system will go into hibernate mode and you can take your power nap. Isn't it helpful?

## Why I Built This
We all feel sleepy during long working hours staring continuously at the screen. You can use this application to make optimize your working time. â€‹

## Future Scope
An automatic switch on and off system based on Pomodoro technique can be implemented.
